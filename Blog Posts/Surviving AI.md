AI is the latest and greatest buzzword. Well, more than a buzzword. If you had asked me a year ago I would have just commented that AI is a passing fad - a bubble. However, the past couple of months of using and understanding it. I am convinced this is the dawn of a new era. Not just for software engineers - but to the entire world. 
## Similarities with DotCom Bubble

You see it often, and you hear about it in all anti-AI posts, articles that the AI growth chart mirrors the dotcom one before it crashed. Essentially claiming it's a bubble.

Well, maybe they are correct, maybe the AI startups will crash. But you know what? Look around you today. The DotCom was not a bubble. The entire world has transformed around the web. Internet today is a foundational piece of infrastructure not unlike the roads, and highways.

Paramount for development and growth of an economy.

So maybe the market crashed in the dotcom era - the technology didn't. It transformed our world, our interactions, our perspectives forever. For better of for worse, transform it did.
## The AI era

AI - artificial intelligence - maybe a slightly misleading name. Do I think it can handle logic like a true intelligence? No I don't think so - thinking otherwise will only lead to either disappointment or worse - incorrect or buggy results.

AI from what I see is a new form of interaction. We need to understand that it's ultimately a smart statistics based natural language query engine. What does it query? Well the large corpus of it's training data - and any additional information you provide via the context window.

Think about the agentic systems being developed - it's not exactly a smart or intelligent system. It's a automation based on carefully curated training data. The genius of it doesn't lie in building a system that can understand instructions - rather creating instructions that a statistics based autocomplete can integrate and respond it.

With tools like Model Context Protocol (MCP) we can envision a new era of computing where gone are the days of buttons, and text boxes. Instead our software will be based on natural language.

The way Tony Stark interacts with his computer? No longer a distant vision. All you need today is a MCP server and you can just tell your favorite AI to search web or create a document or write code.
## How not to approach AI

### 1. AI replacing humans

Ultimately AI is a psuedo-intelligence. It doesn't have critical thinking, nor does it have the ability to take accountability. As such, it can't replace the human element.

Do I think people will lose jobs? Unfortunately yes, just like how automation eliminated so many roles, AI will too. After all, AI is just the next stage of "automation".

But I don't think AI today and the tech it's based on, can replace humans completely from a chain of job. It needs oversight. As such, we need to think about AI tools as a way to augment and make the humans more productive.

Microsoft's idea of "Copilot", in my opinion is the correct one. AI is a copilot. An intern who has all the theoretical knowledge in the world in our finger tips. But will need supervision and guidance to get things done.
### 2. Trust AI as source of truth

AI will make mistakes. In fact, AI will confidently make mistakes making it much harder to trust whether it's bullshitting or not. In fact, I have had experiences where it completely misunderstood the point in a blog post and misrepresented it as the opposite of what the author meant.

Basically, don't ask AI about research questions. Or use it for research. A quick lookup of facts? Sure. Something that requires critical thinking and analyzing nuance? Na, do it manually.

Especially relevant when there are "thinking" models out there. I think those are better suited for agentic systems whether it might need to distill tasks, or break it down to smaller tasks. I haven't felt it to be good at coming to logical conclusions given a set of statements.
### 3. Treat it like a person

Imagine the scenario -
